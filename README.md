This capstone project focuses on analyzing the Northwind database, a sales dataset, using Python.
The project is divided into two key parts:

Business Data Analysis – Exploring customer, product, and sales behavior using SQL and data visualization.

Sales Forecasting – Applying time series models to forecast future sales trends 

🎯 Objectives

Explore the Northwind database structure and relationships.

Perform key business analyses (customer performance, product trends, profitability).

Forecast monthly sales using time series models.

Recommend business strategies based on insights.
